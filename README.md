# Generate My README

## Description

Every single coding project and assignment needs a README page. This README Generator was created to make the process of creating a professional README smooth and simple for anyone regardless of your coding skills.

Markdown skills are not required to use this app... all you have to do is launch the app in your console, answer some questions, and let the magic happen. Sick of the endless repetition and the constant need to reference the markdown documentation? Then this is the app for you.

Creating a README Generator was extremely fun and rewarding, so if you have any further suggestions of improvement to the application, please feel free to clone it down and transform it into YOUR go-to README generator.
